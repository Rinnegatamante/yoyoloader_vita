STR_YES=Yes
STR_NO=No
STR_GLES1_DESC=Enforces GLES1 as rendering backend mode. May improve performances or make a game go further when crashing.
STR_BILINEAR_DESC=Enforces bilinear filtering on textures.
STR_PLAT_TARGET_DESC=Sets the reported target mode to the Runner as the specified platform. Some games require a specific target platform to properly handle inputs.
STR_DEBUG_SHADERS_DESC=Enables dumping of attempted shader translations by the built-in GLSL to CG shader translator in ux0:data/gms/shared/glsl.
STR_DEBUG_MODE_DESC=Enables debug logging in ux0:data/gms/shared/yyl.log.
STR_SPLASH_SKIP_DESC=Disables splashscreen rendering at game boot.
STR_EXTRA_MEM_DESC=Allows the Runner to use approximately extra 12 MBs of memory. May break some debugging tools and breaks virtual keyboard usage from games.
STR_SQUEEZE_DESC=Makes the Loader setup vitaGL with the lowest amount possible of dedicated memory for internal buffers. Increases available mem for the game at the cost of potential performance loss.
STR_OPTIMIZE_DESC=Reduces apk size by removing unnecessary data inside it and improves performances by recompressing files one by one depending on their expected use.
STR_COMPRESS_DESC=Compresses textures during externalization of assets. Reduces memory usage of the game and speedups textures loading process but increases storage usage.
STR_EXTRA_POOL_DESC=Increases the size of the memory pool available for the Runner. May solve some crashes.
STR_VIDEO_PLAYER_DESC=Enables Video Player implementation in the Runner at the cost of potentially reducing the total amount of memory available for the game.
STR_NETWORK_DESC=Enables network functionalities implementation in the Runner at the cost of potentially reducing the total amount of memory available for the game.
